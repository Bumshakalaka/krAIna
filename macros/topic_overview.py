"""
The macro file is a regular script that can be run like a typical Python script,
but it can also function as a macro within the Chat application.
It must contain a `run()` function, which is the only requirement for it to be executable within the Chat application.
When the macro file is loaded by the Chat application as a module, it inspects the `run()` function to get docstring and parameters + annotations.
Subsequently, when the macro is called, the `run()` function is executed in a daemon thread.
In this mode, the Chat application logger is used.

Communication with the Chat application is facilitated through the `ChatInterface()` class.

Here is a concise explanation of the program flow:

1. **Initialization and Setup:**
   - Load environment variables using `load_dotenv(find_dotenv())`.
   - Initialize `Assistants` and a `ChatInterface` with `silent=True` to avoid exceptions if the chat app isn't running.
   - Configure the language model (LLM) settings, specifically `max_tokens` and `model`.

2. **Interaction with the LLM:**
   - Use the LLM to generate a comprehensive description of the given topic. This involves multiple stages:
     - Requesting a brief overview.
     - Asking for a detailed history of the topic.
     - Discussing pros and cons.
     - Including examples, statistics, or anecdotes.
     - Outlining and generating the HTML document based on the gathered context.

3. **HTML Document Generation:**
   - Iteratively request chunks of HTML code from the LLM until the document is complete (`__DONE__` flag).
   - Clean and append each chunk of HTML content to a list.

4. **Finalization:**
   - Write the complete HTML content to the specified output file.
   - Inform the chat app of the document's link for future reference.
   - Return the absolute path of the generated HTML document.
